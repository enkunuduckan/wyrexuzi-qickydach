Overview
A groundbreaking book that boldly claims the key to success is not talent, connections, or ideas, but the ability to persuade people to take a chance on your potential.
  
 &quot;The most exceptional people aren&#039;t just brilliant...they&#039;re backable.&quot; —Daniel Pink, #1 New York Times bestselling author of When, Drive  and To Sell is Human
  
 No one makes it alone. But there’s a reason some people can get investors or bosses to believe in them while others cannot. And that reason has little to do with experience, pedigree, or a polished business plan. Backable people seem to have a hidden quality that inspires others to take action. We often chalk
 this up to natural talent or charisma...either you have “it” or you don’t.

 After getting rejected by every investor he pitched, Suneel Gupta had a burning question: Could “it” be learned?

 Drawing lessons from hundreds of the world’s biggest thinkers, Gupta discovered how to pitch new ideas in a way that has raised millions of dollars, influenced large-scale change inside massive corporations, and even convinced his eight-year-old daughter to clean her room. Inside Backable are long-held secrets from producers of Oscar-winning films, members of Congress, military leaders, culinary stars, venture capitalists, founders of unicorn-status startups, and executives at iconic companies like Lego, Method, and Pixar.

Backable reveals how the key to success is not charisma, connections, or even your résumé, but rather your ability to persuade others to
 take a chance on you. This original book will show you how.
