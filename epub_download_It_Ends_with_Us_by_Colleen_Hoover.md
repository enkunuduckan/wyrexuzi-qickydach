SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE STARRING BLAKE LIVELY AND JUSTIN BALDONI!
 
 From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of It Starts with Us and All Your Perfects, a ‚Äúbrave and heartbreaking novel that digs its claws into you and doesn‚Äôt let go, long after you‚Äôve finished it‚Äù (Anna Todd, New York Times bestselling author) about a workaholic with a too-good-to-be-true romance who can‚Äôt stop thinking about her first love.
 
 Lily hasn‚Äôt always had it easy, but that‚Äôs never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She‚Äôs come a long way from the small town where she grew up‚Äîshe graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily‚Äôs life seems too good to be true.
 
 Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He‚Äôs also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt. Lily can‚Äôt get him out of her head. But Ryle‚Äôs complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his ‚Äúno dating‚Äù rule, she can‚Äôt help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.
 
 As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan‚Äîher first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.
 
 An honest, evocative, and tender novel, It Ends with Us is ‚Äúa glorious and touching read, a forever keeper. The kind of book that gets handed down‚Äù (USA TODAY).
