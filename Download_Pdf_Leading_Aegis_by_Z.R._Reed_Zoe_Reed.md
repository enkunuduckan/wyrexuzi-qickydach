In a world where Captain Carolina Trace could&amp;#039;ve been an indentured worker, or a soldier for a corrupt government, she chose the freedom of piracy instead. But what the rest of the world doesn&amp;#039;t know is that she&amp;#039;s cursed, and bound to her ship, Omen, for all but a few hours at a time. When her most recent quest to break the curse puts her on a trajectory to cross paths with Ophelia, a fugitive doctor, and Wyatt, a Sovereign soldier, she might just have to reevaluate the things that are most important to her.
 
 What is she willing to sacrifice for her freedom? And what is she willing to sacrifice when her freedom isn&amp;#039;t the only thing at stake?
