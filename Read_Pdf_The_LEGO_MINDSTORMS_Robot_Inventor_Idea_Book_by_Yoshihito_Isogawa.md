Overview
A follow-up to the best-selling LEGOÂ® Technic Idea Book series by master builder and LEGO luminary Yoshihito Isogawa, readers learn to create their own robots from the LEGO MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor Set.

 If youâ€™ve had your fun building programmable, intelligent creations with the LEGOÂ® MINDSTORMSÂ® Robot Inventor set, itâ€™s time to take your bot-building to the next level! With over 125 new models, the LEGO MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor Idea Book will unleash your imagination and open up limitless possibilities for unique robotic designs.

 Youâ€™ll learn how to build basic mechanisms with motors and sensors, robots that can walk or drive themselves, and practical tools for lifting, opening doors, drawing, and even launching projectiles. Then, bring them all to life with the LEGO MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor App, which lets you program your bots to perform tasks and missions.

 Each model is paired with an illustrated list of parts and multi-angled color photographs, so you can easily reproduce the projects without the need for step-by-step instructions. Best of all, youâ€™ll also be inspired to combine various mechanisms into your own interactive inventions, toys, cars, games, and more!

 To build the bookâ€™s models, all you need is the LEGOÂ® MINDSTORMSÂ® Robot Inventor set (#51515) and a smart device that can run the MINDSTORMS App.
